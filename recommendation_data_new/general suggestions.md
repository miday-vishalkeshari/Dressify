Bright Accents and Soft Neutrals are just categories to help you build outfits with the right balance of contrast and harmony for your skin tone:

Bright Accents

    What they are: These are vivid, high‑contrast colors that “pop” against your skin.

    Purpose: To draw attention—think statement pieces like a bold blouse, scarf, or accessory.

    Effect: They add vibrancy and energy, making your complexion look more radiant by contrast.

Soft Neutrals

    What they are: These are more muted, understated shades that sit closer to your skin tone on the color spectrum.

    Purpose: To serve as wardrobe “anchors”—basics like pants, jackets, or dresses that pair easily with accents.

    Effect: They create a harmonious backdrop that lets your bright accents shine without overwhelming your overall look.


How to Combine Them
    Balanced Outfit: Pair one bright accent piece (e.g., a cobalt‑blue top) with two soft neutrals (e.g., dove‑gray trousers and a creamy off‑white cardigan).

    Statement‑Only: Wear multiple accents together for a bolder look—but keep at least one neutral to break it up.

    Casual Day: All neutrals with a small pop of color (e.g., a neutral dress plus a bright coral belt).

Color‑Pairing Rules (color theory)

        Complementary: opposite on the wheel (e.g. blue ↔ orange)

        Analogous: adjacent (e.g. teal → turquoise → blue)

        Triadic: evenly spaced (e.g. red → yellow → blue)

You can pre‑compute a small lookup for each palette color:



=================================================================

Two‑Stage Recommendation Flow
    Stage 1: “Pick Your Top”
        Input: user’s skin tone (e.g. FAIR) and desired item type (e.g. TShirt).

        Lookup: palette = palettes[FAIR]

        Select:

        If item is a “statement” (TShirt, Jacket, Sweater), pick from brightAccents.

        If item is a “base” (Pants, Skirt, Shorts), pick from softNeutrals.


    Stage 2: “Match Your Bottom”
        Input: the selected top color (e.g. #4169E1).

        Lookup: pairing = pairingRules["#4169E1"]

        Choose Strategy:

        Complementary for bold contrast

        Analogous for a harmonious look

        Neutral fallback if the user wants something safe

=============================================================

we first need to have a list of all colours which suites on a person
then let user pick his first selection 
then suggest its matching based on the its matching with the first style selected (and this would be from the domain of user suites colours)
